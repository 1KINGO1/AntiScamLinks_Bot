<h1>AntiScamLinks_Bot</h1>
The bot does not provide full protection against scam links. The bot is able to detect scam links by itself according to two criteria, which can be changed in the config.

<h1>Features | 🐵</h1>
<h3>• 5 ways of protection with the possibility of configuration</h3>
<h3>• Easy to set up handlers </h3>

<h1>Setup | 🌱</h1>
<h4>First, run the command:</h4>

```
npm install
```

<h4>For the bot to work correctly, you need to specify your token in the config.</h4>

<h4>There are only 5 ways to check a link:</h4>
<h5>• cssChecker  -  `false or true` (Check whether the site has a discord CSS (in some cases it may not work correctly))</h5>
<h5>• websiteIconChecker  -  `false or true` (Check whether the site has an discord ICON (in some cases it may not work correctly))</h5>
<h5>• inSiteBlackWordsList  -  `false or array` (Checks if the SITE CONTENT has words from the list)</h5>
<h5>• inSiteTitleBlackWordsList  -  `false or array` (Checks if the SITE TITLE has words from the list)</h5>
<h5>• blackListWords  -  `false or array` (Checks if the USER MESSAGE has words from the list)</h5>

<h4>You can run the bot with a command:</h4>

```
node src/main
```

<h4>! If errors occur at startup, the bot will most likely not work correctly. 👿</h4>


<h1>Setting up | 🛠</h1>

<h4>You can change the bot's behavior when a bad link is detected. To do this, you can change /middleware/basicMiddle or add new.</h4>

<h4>The Middleware handler can take the message object as an argument and interact with it.</h4>
<h4>If you add your own handler, don't forget to leave a link to it in the config</h4>
